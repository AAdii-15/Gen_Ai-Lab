## 📌 Overview

**PulseIQ AI** is a voice-powered, multi-disease early detection system that analyzes a user's voice to identify early risk indicators of multiple diseases — all from a single 30-second voice sample. No wearables, no blood tests, no hospital visits required.

> "Your voice carries more health information than you think."

## 🚨 The Problem

- Diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, cardiac conditions, and cognitive decline are often detected **too late**
- Existing early detection tools are **expensive, invasive, and inaccessible** to the general public
- Most AI-based voice tools detect only **one disease at a time**
- Rural and elderly populations have **limited access** to diagnostic facilities

---

## 💡 Our Solution

PulseIQ AI uses **voice biomarker analysis** combined with **Generative AI** to:
- Analyze acoustic features (pitch, tremor, jitter, shimmer, breathiness) from voice
- Detect early risk indicators for **multiple diseases simultaneously**
- Provide **explainable AI results** (not just a score — but *why*)
- Work on any **smartphone**, in **multiple languages**
