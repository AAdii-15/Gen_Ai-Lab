## Overview

**PulseIQ AI** is a voice-powered, multi-disease early detection system that analyzes a user's voice to identify early risk indicators of multiple diseases — all from a single 30-second voice sample. No wearables, no blood tests, no hospital visits required.

> "Your voice carries more health information than you think."

## The Problem

- Diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, cardiac conditions, and cognitive decline are often detected **too late**
- Existing early detection tools are **expensive, invasive, and inaccessible** to the general public
- Most AI-based voice tools detect only **one disease at a time**
- Rural and elderly populations have **limited access** to diagnostic facilities

---

##  Our Solution

PulseIQ AI uses **voice biomarker analysis** combined with **Generative AI** to:
- Analyze acoustic features (pitch, tremor, jitter, shimmer, breathiness) from voice
- Detect early risk indicators for **multiple diseases simultaneously**
- Provide **explainable AI results** (not just a score — but *why*)
- Work on any **smartphone**, in **multiple languages**

##  Research Foundation

This project is backed by peer-reviewed research from **Nature**, **The Lancet**, **MDPI**, and **PMC** confirming that voice biomarkers can reliably detect diseases including Parkinson's, cognitive impairment, diabetes, cardiac issues, and more.

See [`LITERATURE_REVIEW.md`](./LITERATURE_REVIEW.md) for full details.

##  Vision

To make early disease detection as simple as **making a phone call** — accessible to everyone, everywhere, in any language.
