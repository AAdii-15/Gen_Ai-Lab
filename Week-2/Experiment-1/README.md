## CSET419 – Introduction to Generative AI
### Week 2 – Experiment 1

**Experiment Title:**  
Training a Basic GAN for MNIST Image Generation

**Objective:**  
To implement and train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates synthetic handwritten digit images using the MNIST dataset.

**Description:**  
This experiment uses a Generator and Discriminator network trained adversarially.  
The Generator learns to create realistic MNIST-like images from random noise, while the Discriminator learns to distinguish real images from fake ones.  
Generated images are saved during training, and final images are evaluated using a trained MNIST classifier.

**Tools & Frameworks:**  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Google Colab  

**Dataset:**  
- MNIST (Handwritten Digits)
