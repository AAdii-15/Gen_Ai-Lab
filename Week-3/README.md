# Week 3 – Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

This experiment implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as part of  
**CSET419 – Introduction to Generative AI**.

## Objective
- Learn latent representations of image data  
- Generate new samples from a learned probability distribution  

## Dataset
- Fashion-MNIST (28×28 grayscale images of clothing items)

## Methodology
- Encoder–Decoder architecture  
- Latent mean and log-variance estimation  
- Reparameterization trick  
- Reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss  

## Results
- Successful reconstruction of input images  
- Generation of new Fashion-MNIST samples  
- Slight blurriness observed, which is expected behavior for VAEs  

## Tools & Framework
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Google Colab
